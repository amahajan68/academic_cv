abstract: >
  The unprecedented urban expansion projected by the UN - equivalent to adding
  250 New York Cities globally by 2050 - will strain infrastructure and resources,
  posing a critical challenge to creating sustainable cities. Traditional urban
  planning methods struggle to address this rapidly evolving crisis, requiring a
  shift toward systems-oriented approaches that use predictive modeling for fast,
  informed decision-making. To address this need, we developed an educational
  exercise aimed at teaching architectural students how to optimize building
  energy consumption using surrogate modeling. This interactive game allows
  participants to adjust key design parameters with the goal of minimizing heating
  and cooling load. The exercise provides real-time feedback on energy performance,
  enabling participants to refine strategies within the gameâ€™s constraints. The
  game improves participants' understanding of energy optimization in early design
  stages, enabling quick, cost-effective decisions by reducing simulation times
  from hours to seconds. It fosters an energy modeling culture in architectural
  education, preparing future architects to make informed, sustainable design choices.
